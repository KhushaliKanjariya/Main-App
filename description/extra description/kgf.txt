K.G.F: Chapter 1 is a 2018 Indian Kannada-language period action film[7][8] written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale films. It is the first instalment in the two-part series, followed by K.G.F: Chapter 2. The film centres around Raja Krishnappa Bairya "Rocky", born into poverty, who arrives in Bombay (now Mumbai) in the 1960s, on a quest for power and wealth as desired by his dying mother. Involved with the gold mafia there, he is recruited to kill Garuda, the oppressive heir-in-waiting, in Kolar Gold Fields. Yash stars as Rocky, while Ramachandra Raju features as Garuda. Anant Nag narrates the film while also playing a supporting role alongside Srinidhi Shetty, Vasishta N. Simha, Ayyappa P. Sharma and Harish Rai.

The development of the film began in early 2015 when Neel completed writing the screenplay.[9] However, filming began only two years later, in March 2017.[10] Majority of the film is set in Kolar Gold Fields and was filmed on location.[11] Bhuvan Gowda served as the cinematographer and Shrikanth as the editor. Ravi Basrur scored music for the soundtrack and the film's background.[12]
